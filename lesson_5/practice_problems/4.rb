Practice Problem 4
For each of these collection objects where the value 3 occurs, demonstrate how you would change this to 4.
=end

arr1 = [1, [2, 3], 4]
arr1[1][1] = 4
p arr1

arr2 = [{a: 1}, {b: 2, c: [7, 6, 5], d: 4}, 3]
arr2[2] = 4
p arr2

hsh1 = {first: [1, 2, [3]]}
hsh1[:first][2][0] = 4
p hsh1

hsh2 = {['a'] => {a: ['1', :two, 3], b: 4}, 'b' => 5}
hsh2[['a']][:a][2] = 4
p hsh2

LS Solution

arr1[1][1] = 4
arr1 # => [1, [2, 4], 4]

arr2[2] = 4
arr2 # => [{:a=>1}, {:b=>2, :c=>[7, 6, 5], :d=>4}, 4]

hsh1[:first][2][0] = 4
hsh1 # => {:first=>[1, 2, [4]]}

hsh2[['a']][:a][2] = 4
hsh2 # => {["a"]=>{:a=>["1", :two, 4], :b=>4}, "b"=>5}

In the last example the key for the first item in the outer hash is actually an array containing a single 
string object ["a"]. Although this is unusual, it is important to remember that both hash keys and values can 
be any Ruby object.
